  <p>JavaScript often abbreviated JS, is a programming language
    that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.
    As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior,
    often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated
    JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.</p>

  <p>javascript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms
    to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation,
    and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional,
    and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs)
    for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
