    <div>Servers and resources on the World Wide Web are identified and located through
      character strings called uniform resource locators (URLs). The original and still
      very common document type is a web page formatted in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).
      This markup language supports plain text, images, embedded video and audio contents,
      and scripts (short programs) that implement complex user interaction.</div>
